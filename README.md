# Information

- :fairy: Spring boot is used for fast development since it takes care of everything like automating magical bean carrier code fairies
- :hourglass_flowing_sand:Hibernate and H2 works like charm and they are the key of fast development since this is a case study, time is money!
- :moneybag:Lombok saved me a lot of time for not letting me type boilerplate code at compile time, again time is money!
- :gear:Everything needs to work! Junit put them in line.
- :bookmark_tabs:Documenting your code with Javadoc is important but how about Rest api documentation ? OpenAPI is the go!
